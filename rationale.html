						<p>
							Here we will list all the features and specifications implemented on the site as well as the function planned, but that could not be implemented. We will also justify our decisions for choosing the layout and design.
						</p>
						<br  />
						<h2>Implemented features:</h2>
						<h3><a href="homepage.html">About Homepage</a></h3>
						<ul class="corner">
							<li>
								We use a responsive design model, the page has two styles controlled by whether the screen size is bigger or smaller than 1024px
							</li>
							<li>
								We design simple but elegant appearance to reflect professionalism.
							</li>
							<li>
								we show our team-members' beautiful photos to make the page more lively and the client knows who we are.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3><a href="protosite/index.html">About Protosite</a></h3>
						<ul class="corner">
							<li>
								<a href="protosite/index.html">protosite homepage page</a> shows the main elements that the page has 
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="protosite/lecturev2.html"> lecture page</a> we added a navigation aside bar with bookmarks of the document contents because lectures have a lot of information and is divided in subtopics. Also we added an optional feature to return the user to top of the page for commodity.
							</li>

							<li>
								<a href="protosite/quizv2.html">quiz page</a> is implemented with jquery form ui plugin, which has beautiful appearance and powerful validation function.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="protosite/resourcesv2.html">resources page</a> is designed to have special looks not just simple list the resources links, this page also have two styles for the responsive designed model
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="protosite/error.html">error page</a> is designed to show when the user introduces a bad link.
							</li>
							<li>
								The design of the site has the navigation bar at the top, so that the user can navigate the site whenever they want as it's a common trend these days. Originally we were using a Jquery but we changed it to a simple css trick we learned. This is because since part of the course introduces Jquery techniques, we wanted that final users of the site could demonstrate this Jquery technique in their assignments.<br /><br />
								
								Since some features like the aside navigation/link bar and the back to the top link may not be featured in the designated page we decided to use Javascript to detect their presence and in given case modify the width of the remaining elements.<br /><br />
								
								The style is full with css3 and html5 technology, like new html tags, border-radius, css properties abbreviation, etc.<br /><br />
								
								We conserved the pictures that were on the site because the questionnaire indicated so. Only we changed the colours of the banners so that they felt related to our homepage.<br /><br />
								
								We moved the contact link to the footer, and also added a site map on it. As it's a common feature nowadays and considering the site purpose and size (about 25 links distributed in 3 columns) we believed its a good idea.<br /><br />
								
								Finally we added a server functionality so that we did could manipulate the header and footer sections easily, and access to a error page of our own.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3><a href="#">About rationale</a></h3>
						<ul class="corner">
							<li> using jquery corner plugin to  it adds magic effects to the "list paragraph" to show a blue background and "bite" corner </li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Others</h3>

								Overhead style to show on the projector - optimized to prioritize the content
							</li>
							<li>
								Iterative Sitemap - easy access with a clickable diagrama.
							</li>

								Third...
